1. Annie_Store (MVC): 
I've got to be much more familiar with MVC model by practical programming. In this project, I've learnt how to paginate, cart handling, notifications, CRUD products/brands/categories and SQL server. 
However, I only did the migrations to convert Models class to tables int DB. 
I'd love to try another approach beside migrations.

2. GrandLoopStock (API):
I mainly did CRUD and tokenizer(JWT - a NEW thing and I prefer it to cookies).
API models, to me, is more concise than MVC (because we do not need to program the Views). So, there will be more API-model projects from me later.
